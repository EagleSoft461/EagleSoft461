# Hi there, I'm Ali Orhan! 👋
### AI-Oriented Full-Stack Engineer | Hardware–Software Systems

I build **end-to-end software solutions** — from scalable backend systems and APIs to modern web and mobile interfaces — with a strong focus on **AI-powered features**, **computer vision**, and **performance-aware architectures**.

I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
---

## 🚀 What I Build
- Full-stack applications (backend, frontend, and mobile)
- AI-powered tools and computer vision pipelines
- Systems designed with performance, memory, and deployment constraints in mind

---
## 🔌 Hardware–Software Integration
- Hardware treated as system clients rather than isolated components
- Data pipelines designed from device-level input to backend processing
- Performance-aware integration between hardware constraints and software systems

## 🧠 Featured Project:
**AI Background Remover (Full-Stack)**  
End-to-end application that allows users to remove backgrounds from images using AI models.

- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI, AI inference with OpenCV & PyTorch  
- **Frontend:** React, responsive web interface  
- **Deployment:** Dockerized, scalable architecture  

• Optimized inference pipeline to reduce processing latency  
• Designed with modular architecture for easy scaling and model replacement  

> Demonstrates **full-stack development**, **AI integration**, and **performance-aware system design**.
